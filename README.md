# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

This Capstone project is the culmination of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, synthesizing the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course series into a comprehensive project.

### üìò Project Background

SpaceX stands at the forefront of the commercial space era, revolutionizing space travel affordability. With Falcon 9 rocket launches priced at 62 million dollars‚Äîcompared to over 165 million dollars from other providers‚ÄîSpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of their rockets is a significant cost-saving factor. Predicting whether the first stage will successfully land can thus indicate the overall cost of a launch. This project leverages public data and machine learning models to forecast the reuse potential of SpaceX's first stage rockets.

### üìä Key Questions

1. How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits influence the success of the first stage landing?
2. Has the success rate of first stage landings increased over the years?
3. What is the most effective algorithm for binary classification in predicting the first stage landing success?

### üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Utilizing SpaceX REST API.
   - Web scraping data from Wikipedia.
   
2. **Data Wrangling:**
   - Filtering and cleaning the data.
   - Addressing missing values.
   - Applying One Hot Encoding for binary classification preparation.
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducting EDA using visualizations and SQL.
   
4. **Interactive Visual Analytics:**
   - Creating interactive visualizations with Folium and Plotly Dash.
   
5. **Predictive Analysis:**
   - Developing, tuning, and evaluating classification models to identify the most accurate predictive algorithm.

By following this methodology, the project aims to provide insights into the factors affecting the success of SpaceX's first stage landings and identify the best machine learning techniques for this binary classification problem.
